# JP Morgan Work Experience

We’re excited to offer you the opportunity to explore life as a software engineer at JPMorgan Chase and obtain valuable technology skills required to drive your career in the direction you want it to go.

At JPMorgan Chase, we invest $10 billion a year to enable our technologists to work on a diverse range of solutions that include strategic technology initiatives, big data, mobile, electronic payments, machine learning, cybersecurity, enterprise cloud development, and other state-of-the-art technologies.

Throughout the job , you'll familiarize yourself with JPMorgan Chase frameworks and apply your technical skills to a hypothetical request from the firm’s trading floor to analyse and visualize data in a new way.

## Task One: Interface with Data Feed

You’ve been asked to assist with some development to add a chart to a trader’s dashboard allowing them to better identify under/over-valued stocks.

The trader would like to be able to monitor two historically correlated stocks and be able to visualise when the correlation between the two weakens (i.e. one stock moves proportionally more than the historical correlation would imply). This could indicate a potential trade strategy to simultaneously buy the relatively underperforming stock and sell the relatively outperforming stock. Assuming the two prices subsequently converge, the trade should be profitable.

Most data visualisation for our traders is built on JPMorgan Chase's Perspective data visualisation software, which is now open source. If you want to explore that, a link is provided in the resources section.

Before implementing this request using perspective, first, you’ll need to interface with the relevant financial data feed and make the necessary adjustments to facilitate the monitoring of potential trade opportunities.

## Task Two: JPMorgan Framework and Tools

Typically, traders monitor stock prices and trading strategies by having data displayed visually on their screens in chart form. Often these charts will be accompanied by alerts that notify users when certain events occur or when preset price thresholds are hit.

JPMorgan Chase created the Perspective tool over many years to allow users to present and manipulate data feeds visually in web applications.

Perspective provides a set of flexible data transforms, such as pivots, filters, and aggregations. It utilises bleeding-edge browser technology such as Web Assembly and Apache Arrow and is unmatched in browser performance. It is engineered for reliability and production-vetted on the JPMorgan Chase trading floor. Now it’s available to the development community as an open source library. If you want to explore that, a link is provided in the resources section.

## Task Three: Display Visual Data

Being able to access and adjust data feeds is critical to trading analysis and stock price monitoring. With the prior tasks complete, we have the adjusted data set up on your system and piped into Perspective.

For traders to have a complete picture of all the trading strategies being monitored, several screens typically display an assortment of live and historical data at their workstations.

Given that an enormous amount of information and data are produced at once, visualising data in a clear manner with UI/UX considerations accounted for is critical to providing traders with the tools to improve their performance.

## Task Four (Lite): Unit Testing Suite

You work in the credit rewards department at JPMorgan Chase. Your team handles conversions from dollars to credit card points, credit card points to miles, miles to credit card points, and so on. Today, you are working on a ticket involving the RewardsConverter system, which needs a new part to function. This system is missing a crucial class, which you’ll be creating over the course of this program.

The RewardsConverter system accepts a cash value and returns the corresponding value in airline miles. The system needs a RewardValue class to function, which represents the correspondence between currencies, be it cash, airline miles, or something else. It will handle the conversion between all of these scales. In this task, you will set up your local development environment for coding and implement the aforementioned class.
